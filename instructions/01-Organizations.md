## AWS Organizations

First, we are going to need a couple of AWS accounts.

1. Log on to your AWS account. Let's call this _the master_ account.

1. Go to **AWS Organizations**.

1. Click on **Add account**.


1. Click on **Create account**.

![create option](../images/acc_create.png)

1. Add an account with the following details:
    * **Full name:** `Workshop Account 1`
      **Email:** `yourusername+account1@yourgoogledomain`
      **IAM role name:** (leave blank) `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`

![create option](../images/acc1_create.png)

![Account 1](../images/AWS_org_acc1.png)
account, using AWS CLI.
    1. Open `Makefile`.
    1. Modify `ACC2_EMAIL` variable to `yourusername+account2@yourgoogledomain`
    1. Add the following command to the `account2` target:

        ```Makefile
        aws organizations create-account \
        	--account-name '$(ACC2_NAME)' \
        	--email '$(ACC2_EMAIL)'
        ```
    1. Run

       ```Bash
        $ make account2
        ```

  ![bash create](../images/bash_acc2.png)

1. Go back to **AWS Organizations** and note account numbers for your master
   account as well as the two new accounts we just created.
   This may take a minute to show.
   
![Accounts](../images/org_acc_list.png)

2. Open `Makefile` and set values of each account number variable accordingly.

Let's access these accounts.

1. From your account's context menu, click on **Switch Role**.

1. Enter the following details:
    * **Account:** (Account 1's number)
      **Role:** OrganizationAccountAccessRole
      **Display Name:** Workshop Account 1
      **Color:** Yellow (3rd box from the left)

    From the context menu, click on **Switch Role** again.

    * **Account:** (Account 2's number)
      **Role:** OrganizationAccountAccessRole
      **Display Name:** Workshop Account 2
      **Color:** Blue (5th box from the left)

You can now switch between your accounts with only a couple of clicks.

`OrganizationAccountAccessRole` is a role that exists in sub-accounts that have
the `AdministratorAccess` policy attached while having a trust relationship
with the master account they were created from.

Move onto the next step.
