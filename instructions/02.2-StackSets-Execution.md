1. Review the configuration. Acknowledge that your template is creating IAM
   resources and click on **Submit**.

You'll now see your StackSets deploying. This may take a while. You can refresh
the **Operations** tab to see the progress. Alternatively, you can switch into
the sub-accounts and inspect the CloudFormation Stack that's being deployed in
it.

Now with the `WorkshopCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole` we can run
CloudFormation with restricted access.
